# Movies-ETL
## Summary
For this analysis, I was tasked with creating an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I refactored code previously created in the module to make it more streamlined. The analysis used movie data from multiple sources, cleaned, and combined the data, as well as movie ratings data to create two tables. The results for the data transformation, as well as images for the tables can be found in the attached files.
